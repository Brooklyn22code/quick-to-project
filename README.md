This is a very easy CLI tool help you doing that without touching mouse.

To run this CLI, make sure you download golang compiler, vscode and SQLite.

You first need clone the repo to your computer, and type in the terminal of your repo direction:
go mod tidy

Then type in terminal:
sqlite3 project.db

Finally you put the direction where you clone the repo in the environment variables.

You are done right now, open terminal and type command quickpro, then you should see:
