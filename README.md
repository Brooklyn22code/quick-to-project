Do you think everytime you need to find your project by finding it in the file explorer or open folder in vscode is very slow and looks stupid. 
This is a very easy CLI tool help you doing that without touching mouse.

To run this CLI, make sure you download golang compiler and SQLite.

You first need clone the repo to your computer, in the direction you need to type into terminal: 
go mod tidy

Then type in terminal:
sqlite3 project.db

Finally you put the direction where you clone the repo in the environment variables.

You are done right now, open terminal and type command quickpro, then you should see:
command>
